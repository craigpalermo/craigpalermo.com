title: Now's More Than Ever

If you've ever worked in an organization divided into multiple teams,
segmented by product, let's say, then you may have heard of an interesting
idea from another team that you've wanted to implement for your own.
You feel that their workflow, library, or the like could similarly
benefit your team. However, you haven't the time allocated to put it
into practice. You'd need to justify to your higher-ups that it would
be worth the investment, and your audience's technical experience
can make this any level of difficult.

From my experience, making the investment in the ways and means to improve
a team's quality of life, developer experience, and ostensibly the
quality of the product early on can pay dividends later. The product
and team culture will benefit from avoiding taking on new technical
debt and producing more stable solutions from the start, as well as at
each step of iteration, in addition to the perpetual excitement of
staying ahead of the curve. Would you rather you and your team suffer through
months of uncomfortable and frustrating steps in your daily workflow,
or can you avoid it all by acting today? In the long run, now's worth a lot
more than ever.
