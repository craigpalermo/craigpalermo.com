I've always had trouble finishing books once I've started them. New titles make their way
onto the list, and inevitably pull me away from those in progress before I've
finished. This year, I'm trying to break this habit by maintaining a reading list, which
I hope will keep my choices more focused.

## Books I've finished in 2019:

1. [Make Your Bed: Little Things That Can Change Your Life...And Maybe the World](https://www.amazon.com/Make-Your-Bed-Little-Things/dp/1455570249/ref=sr_1_1?crid=1JB12WJ3B2X0J&keywords=make+your+bed&qid=1550084523&s=gateway&sprefix=make+your%2Caps%2C137&sr=8-1) by William H. McRaven
