title: The Importance of Casual Cross-Team Collaboration

After a year and a half at my current job, I've started to do something
different over the past couple months. Whenever I get the chance, I try
to chat with engineers from other teams. It may seem obvious, but in the
course of these casual conversations, I've learned a lot about how other
teams work within the organization and have even shared solutions
between our teams to the benefit of the entire organization. Had we not
taken the opportunity to familiarize ourselves with our
counterparts from other product teams, we would have missed out on
these shared wins.

Save for organized company meetings, developers (and really employees in any role)
at companies of all sizes and layouts may not have the opportunity to organically
share their ideas and work product with members of other teams. This
includes anything from common components usable by many applications
to best practices that could benefit multiple teams. While Slack channels
and quarterly all-hands meetings help to share big-picture successes, nothing
beats talk over coffee when you want to get informal exposure for your
pet project before it's ready for prime time. 

Nowadays, teams might be divided by office, geolocation, and timezone,
making it even harder to get to know your neighbor. Plenty of resources
can help teams better manage the challenges of remote work, but the idea
remains the same. This effort can pay off greatly by allowing teams
to share their best ideas, even when they're not scheduled into anyone's
quarterly goals.
