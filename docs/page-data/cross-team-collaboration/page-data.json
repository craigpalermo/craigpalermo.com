Whenever I get the chance, I try\nto chat with engineers from other teams. It may seem obvious, but in the\ncourse of these casual conversations, I’ve learned a lot about how other\nteams work within the organization and have even shared solutions\nbetween our teams to the benefit of the entire organization. Had we not\ntaken the opportunity to familiarize ourselves with our\ncounterparts from other product teams, we would have missed out on\nthese shared wins.</p>\n<p>Save for organized company meetings, developers (and really employees in any role)\nat companies of all sizes and layouts may not have the opportunity to organically\nshare their ideas and work product with members of other teams. This\nincludes anything from common components usable by many applications\nto best practices that could benefit multiple teams. While Slack channels\nand quarterly all-hands meetings help to share big-picture successes, nothing\nbeats talk over coffee when you want to get informal exposure for your\npet project before it’s ready for prime time. </p>\n<p>Nowadays, teams might be divided by office, geolocation, and timezone,\nmaking it even harder to get to know your neighbor. Plenty of resources\ncan help teams better manage the challenges of remote work, but the idea\nremains the same. This effort can pay off greatly by allowing teams\nto share their best ideas, even when they’re not scheduled into anyone’s\nquarterly goals.</p>",
