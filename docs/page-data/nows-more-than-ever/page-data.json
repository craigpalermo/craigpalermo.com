However, you haven’t the time allocated to put it\ninto practice. You’d need to justify to your higher-ups that it would\nbe worth the investment, and your audience’s technical experience\ncan make this any level of difficult.</p>\n<p>From my experience, making the investment in the ways and means to improve\na team’s quality of life, developer experience, and ostensibly the\nquality of the product early on can pay dividends later. The product\nand team culture will benefit from avoiding taking on new technical\ndebt and producing more stable solutions from the start, as well as at\neach step of iteration, in addition to the perpetual excitement of\nstaying ahead of the curve. Would you rather you and your team suffer through\nmonths of uncomfortable and frustrating steps in your daily workflow,\nor can you avoid it all by acting today? In the long run, now’s worth a lot\nmore than ever. </p>","frontmatter":{"title":"Now's More Than Ever","date":"May 31, 2019"}}},"pageContext":{"slug":"/nows-more-than-ever/","previous":{"fields":{"slug":"/cross-team-collaboration/"},"frontmatter":{"title":"The Importance of Casual Cross-Team Collaboration"}},"next":{"fields":{"slug":"/building-this-site-with-github-actions/"},"frontmatter":{"title":"Building This Site with GitHub Actions"}}}}}
